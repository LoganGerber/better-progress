A better progress bar than [progress](https://github.com/verigak/progress/).

I made this because the aforementioned package has next to no documentation, is near impossible to use with intellisense because of the excessive reliance on `*args` and `**kwargs` in initializers, and has no docstrings. Also, that package automatically prints the progress bar to stdout, and has no simple way of just getting the string representation of the bar, which absolutely will not do.
